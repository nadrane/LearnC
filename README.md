This repository is a collection of projects I am completing as I work through the book Operating Systems Concepts. They are all written in C and demonstrate some OS level concept. 

Each directory represents a different project. Most of these projects are found in "Programming Projects" or "Programming Problems" sections at the end of each chapter. Although the specifics of the directions of each project are not precisely followed, the projects nevertheless provide heavy inspiration.
