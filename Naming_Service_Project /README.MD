This project is a simple multi-threaded DNS server. It listens for and serves connections at 127.0.0.1:8000. For each connection it will create a new thread. Each thread will run a loop asking the client for a domain name. The server will return the IP address. A connection can be closed by typing 'close' into the client. The server can be shut down by giving a keyboard interrupt.
